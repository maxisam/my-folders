# my-folders

This is a vscode extension based on

- [Explorer Bookmark](https://github.com/UrosVuj/Explorer-Bookmark)
- [Scope to This](https://github.com/rhalaly/scope-to-this-vscode)

with some improvements:

- Rename bookmark name with sorting
- Save data to a configuration file (`.vscode/my-folders.json`)
